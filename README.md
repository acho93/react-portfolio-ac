# React Portfolio

## Description
Using React and the Chakra UI library for styling, I created a portfolio where I introduce myself, display some of my recent projects, and provides a way to reach out to me.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://acho93.github.io/react-portfolio-ac/

## Installation
After cloning the repository from GitHub, install the necessary dependencies using 'npm i'. To run the application on your local browser, run 'npm start'.
